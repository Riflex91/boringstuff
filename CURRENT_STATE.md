### v0.2.15 — PARTIAL PASS

- Demand-based hauler requests.
- Priority for empty / waiting / fallback consumers and longest wait.
- Delivery reservations prevent dogpile.
- Telemetry: `consumerWaitingCount`, `consumerRequestCount`, `consumerDeliveryReservations`.
- Productive throughput improved by approximately 27% versus v0.2.14.
- Remaining issue: consumers could briefly starve during spawn/extension refill bursts.

### v0.2.16 — VERIFIED / CLOSED

Consumer Starvation Guard.

- With at least two haulers and a critical consumer, exactly one transport-ready hauler prioritizes the consumer.
- Other haulers remain available for spawn/extensions/tower.
- One-hauler survival priority unchanged.
- Telemetry: `consumerCriticalCount`.

Verified live window: ticks `3681001–3681100`.

Observed result:

- `consumerFallbackCount = 0`
- `haulerCarryDeficit = 0`
- Health `96 / HEALTHY`
- Logistics `100`
- Controller progress `+180 / 100 ticks`
- Construction progress `+1300 / 100 ticks`
- Productive throughput `14.8 e/t`
- CPU approximately `3.8`
- Bucket `10000`
- No runtime errors
- Dedicated/theoretical mining `20 e/t`
- 3 haulers / 16 CARRY / 12 required

### v0.2.17 — VERIFIED / CLOSED

Live Verification Harness. Tools/observability only; no colony behavior change.

- `npm run verify:smoke` — 25-tick safety gate.
- `npm run verify:live` — complete 100-tick performance gate.
- Timestamp-aware multiline error parsing separates bot/runtime failures from collector faults.
- Collector faults are reported independently as `collector-health`.
- Incomplete evidence windows cannot be mistaken for completed passes.
- Installer mirrors `game/*.js` under the installed test tree while preserving the flat Screeps runtime layout.

Verified live evidence on Node.js `18.20.4`:

- smoke ticks `3682644–3682668`: `PASS=8 / WATCH=1 / FAIL=0`;
- live ticks `3682701–3682800`: `PASS=12 / WATCH=3 / FAIL=0`;
- runtime errors, collector health, CPU/bucket, mining, hard-stall, telemetry continuity, hauler capacity, controller progress, and construction progress all passed in the full live gate;
- remaining WATCH findings: consumer self-supply fallback, productive throughput below mining capacity, and Efficiency `INEFFICIENT`; these are optimization findings, not safety failures.

## Next release boundary

The next intended release is **v0.2.18-node18 — Dedicated Productive Work**.

Measured v0.2.17 evidence shows that mining and aggregate hauling are sufficient, but productive consumers can still spend their carried work energy refilling spawn/extensions, then wait for a hauler to deliver energy back to them. That churn is consistent with the simultaneous WATCH signals for consumer fallback and productive throughput below mining capacity.

The v0.2.18 behavior change is deliberately narrow:

- with **two or more live haulers**, `builder`, `worker`, and `repairer` creeps keep carried energy for productive work instead of assisting spawn/extension refill;
- with **zero or one live hauler**, the existing infrastructure-first recovery behavior is preserved exactly;
- upgrader behavior is unchanged;
- mining, hauler sizing, spawn counts, defense, planner/layout, and expansion policy are unchanged.

Acceptance target after deployment:

- zero hard FAIL in the 25-tick smoke gate;
- zero hard FAIL in a complete 100-tick live gate;
- `haulerCarryDeficit = 0`;
- no regression in runtime/CPU/stall/controller/construction safety;
- consumer fallback should decline and productive throughput should improve or at minimum not regress materially.

## Current strategic interpretation

`E8N1` remains an RCL2 two-source colony in container-logistics mode. The verified v0.2.17 live gate shows that the supply side is not the primary bottleneck:

- dedicated mining is active;
- modeled hauler capacity is sufficient;
- telemetry continuity is healthy;
- CPU/bucket and hard-stall gates are clean;
- controller and construction both make progress.

The remaining optimization signals point at the productive-consumer side instead:

- consumer self-supply fallback still occurs;
- productive throughput trails available mining capacity;
- Efficiency reports `INEFFICIENT`;
- the spawn can remain idle while energy is available.

The next change therefore removes avoidable energy churn before considering more creeps or larger bodies. Do **not** increase mining or hauling capacity solely from the current WATCH state.

## Development invariants

Architecture:

`Colony State -> Problems/Need -> Priorities -> Jobs -> Required Creep Capacity -> Spawn Planning -> Assignment -> Measure -> Reevaluation`

Rules:

- Colony decides; creeps execute.
- Recovery > Growth.
- Economy > Expansion.
- Defense > Expansion.
- Measure before optimizing.
- Use actual throughput rather than a single snapshot.
- Derive tuning constants from telemetry where possible.
- Cache stable calculations.
- Tolerate creep losses, restarts, and Memory persistence.
- Keep planner/strategy separate from layout/build priority.
- Safety invariants are immutable unless explicitly reviewed.
- Historical telemetry/evidence must never be rewritten to make a release look successful.

## Standard verification workflow

For each change:

1. Keep the change small, testable, and regression-safe.
2. Run the full offline regression suite.
3. Deploy only after offline gates pass.
4. Run the 25-tick smoke gate.
5. If there is no hard failure, collect the full 100-tick window.
6. Run the live verification gate.
7. Only then begin the next behavior-changing release.

Typical Windows workflow:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install.ps1
cd tools
npm install
npm test
npm run doctor
npm run deploy
npm run logs
```

Then in the Screeps console:

```js
bot.status()
bot.telemetryStatus()
```

## Secrets and local-only files

Never commit real Screeps credentials, tokens, local collector state, telemetry captures, generated logs, or other private runtime material. `tools/screeps.json.example` is safe to commit; a real `tools/screeps.json` is not.
