- Telemetry: `nextHaulerCarryParts`, `haulerCarryDeficit`.
- Live verification reached 3 haulers / 16 CARRY / 12 required / deficit 0 while recommended stable count remained 2.

### v0.2.15 — PARTIAL PASS

Consumer-Supply Targeting.

- Demand-based hauler requests.
- Priority for empty / waiting / fallback consumers and longest wait.
- Delivery reservations prevent dogpile.
- Telemetry: `consumerWaitingCount`, `consumerRequestCount`, `consumerDeliveryReservations`.
- Productive throughput improved by approximately 27% versus v0.2.14.
- Remaining issue: consumers could briefly starve during spawn/extension refill bursts.

### v0.2.16 — VERIFIED / CLOSED

Consumer Starvation Guard.

- With at least two haulers and a critical consumer, exactly one transport-ready hauler prioritizes the consumer.
- Other haulers remain available for spawn/extensions/tower.
- One-hauler survival priority unchanged.
- Telemetry: `consumerCriticalCount`.

Verified live window: ticks `3681001–3681100`.

Observed result:

- `consumerFallbackCount = 0`
- `haulerCarryDeficit = 0`
- Health `96 / HEALTHY`
- Logistics `100`
- Controller progress `+180 / 100 ticks`
- Construction progress `+1300 / 100 ticks`
- Productive throughput `14.8 e/t`
- CPU approximately `3.8`
- Bucket `10000`
- No runtime errors
- Dedicated/theoretical mining `20 e/t`
- 3 haulers / 16 CARRY / 12 required

### v0.2.17 — VERIFIED / CLOSED

Live Verification Harness. Tools/observability only; no colony behavior change.

- `npm run verify:smoke` — 25-tick safety gate.
- `npm run verify:live` — complete 100-tick performance gate.
- Timestamp-aware multiline error parsing separates bot/runtime failures from collector faults.
- Collector faults are reported independently as `collector-health`.
- Incomplete evidence windows cannot be mistaken for completed passes.
- Installer mirrors `game/*.js` under the installed test tree while preserving the flat Screeps runtime layout.

Verified live evidence on Node.js `18.20.4`:

- smoke ticks `3682644–3682668`: `PASS=8 / WATCH=1 / FAIL=0`;
- live ticks `3682701–3682800`: `PASS=12 / WATCH=3 / FAIL=0`;
- runtime errors, collector health, CPU/bucket, mining, hard-stall, telemetry continuity, hauler capacity, controller progress, and construction progress all passed in the full live gate;
- remaining WATCH findings: consumer self-supply fallback, productive throughput below mining capacity, and Efficiency `INEFFICIENT`; these are optimization findings, not safety failures.

### v0.2.18 — VERIFIED / CLOSED

Dedicated Productive Work.

- With two or more live haulers, `builder`, `worker`, and `repairer` creeps keep carried energy for productive work instead of refilling spawn/extensions.
- With zero or one live hauler, the historical infrastructure-first recovery path remains unchanged.
- Upgrader behavior is unchanged.
- Mining, hauling-capacity models, spawn counts, defense, planning, and expansion are unchanged.
- `npm run verify:live` now waits automatically for the first complete post-deploy 100-tick window, polling collector evidence every 5 seconds.

Verified live window: ticks `3683401–3683500`.

Observed gate result:

- `PASS=13 / WATCH=2 / FAIL=0`
- runtime errors: PASS
- collector health: PASS
- CPU/bucket: PASS
- mining active: PASS
- hard stall: PASS
- telemetry continuity: PASS
- hauler capacity: PASS
- controller progress: PASS
- construction progress: PASS
- consumer supply: WATCH — consumers were waiting/critical, but `consumerFallbackCount` remained `0`
- productive throughput: WATCH — throughput still trails mining capacity
- efficiency status: `EFFICIENT`

The behavior target succeeded: self-supply fallback was eliminated in the verified live window while all hard safety gates remained green.

## Next release boundary

The next intended release is **v0.2.19-node18 — Productive Flow Attribution**.

This is an **OBSERVABILITY-ONLY** release. It must not change creep behavior, spawn policy, mining, hauling, defense, planning, or expansion.

The verified v0.2.18 window left two optimization signals:

- consumers can still become waiting/critical while fallback remains zero;
- productive throughput still trails available mining capacity.

v0.2.19 adds bounded current-state and 100-tick attribution that separates:

- delivery latency: consumer/waiting/critical/fallback/empty creep-ticks, waiting ratios, average/max wait age;
- consumer work capacity: average active WORK parts by productive role plus construction-capable and dedicated-controller capacity;
- construction mix: site count, remaining progress, and remaining progress by structure type;
- controller demand: remaining controller progress, ticks-to-downgrade, and demand-active ratio;
- actual productive throughput split into construction and controller progress per tick.

The live gate must hard-fail a complete 100-tick v0.2.19 window if this attribution is missing or incomplete. Historical telemetry is not rewritten.

## Current strategic interpretation

`E8N1` remains an RCL2 two-source colony in container-logistics mode. v0.2.18 removed the measured consumer self-supply fallback and raised Efficiency to `EFFICIENT`, while mining, hauling, CPU, telemetry continuity, controller progress, and construction progress all remained healthy.

The residual issue is now diagnostic rather than safety-related: some consumers still wait briefly, and aggregate productive throughput remains below mining capacity. Those signals are insufficient to justify more creeps or larger bodies because they do not identify whether the limiter is delivery latency, available WORK capacity, construction backlog composition, or controller demand.

v0.2.19 therefore measures those dimensions first. No control-loop decision may consume the new attribution until a clean live window has been reviewed.

## Development invariants

Architecture:

`Colony State -> Problems/Need -> Priorities -> Jobs -> Required Creep Capacity -> Spawn Planning -> Assignment -> Measure -> Reevaluation`

Rules:

- Colony decides; creeps execute.
- Recovery > Growth.
- Economy > Expansion.
- Defense > Expansion.
- Measure before optimizing.
- Use actual throughput rather than a single snapshot.
- Derive tuning constants from telemetry where possible.
- Cache stable calculations.
- Tolerate creep losses, restarts, and Memory persistence.
- Keep planner/strategy separate from layout/build priority.
- Safety invariants are immutable unless explicitly reviewed.
- Historical telemetry/evidence must never be rewritten to make a release look successful.

## Standard verification workflow

For each change:

1. Keep the change small, testable, and regression-safe.
2. Run the full offline regression suite.
3. Deploy only after offline gates pass.
4. Run the 25-tick smoke gate.
5. If there is no hard failure, collect the full 100-tick window.
6. Run the live verification gate.
7. Only then begin the next behavior-changing release.

Typical Windows workflow:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install.ps1
cd tools
npm install
npm test
npm run doctor
npm run deploy
npm run logs
```

Then in the Screeps console:

```js
bot.status()
bot.telemetryStatus()
```

## Secrets and local-only files

Never commit real Screeps credentials, tokens, local collector state, telemetry captures, generated logs, or other private runtime material. `tools/screeps.json.example` is safe to commit; a real `tools/screeps.json` is not.
